At Glean, we've created a plugin infrastructure on OpenSearch to boost our ranking/scoring logic iteration speed, aiming to provide top-tier workplace search and chat assistant. Balancing rapid experimentation with system robustness required significant investments in infrastructure, tooling, and processes. We've also implemented varied testing layers to safeguard against regressions amidst multiple changes. This talk shares our learnings and progress.
