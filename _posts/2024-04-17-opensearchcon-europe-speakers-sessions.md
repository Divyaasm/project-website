Following an overwhelming response to our call for presentations, the [speakers](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/speakers/index.html) and [sessions](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/sessions/index.html) for OpenSearchCon Europe have been selected. We’re delighted to present 22 sessions covering timely topics related to search, observability, security, operations, performance optimization, and more across 2 days of learning and community building.

To accommodate as many submissions as possible, we’ve decided to include a selection of sessions on the first day of the conference in addition to a full schedule of sessions on the second day. The conference starts on 6 May with a single track of sessions beginning at 10:00 and continuing after lunch. The morning’s agenda also includes a roundtable where partners can collaborate and exchange ideas. The afternoon continues with an [unconference](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/unconference/index.html), during which anyone can pitch a topic for a 15-minute talk, and we’ll end the day with a reception to celebrate our first-ever European user conference. 

If you’re looking for hands-on learning, [OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/) will deliver a one-day intensive course based on its “Think Like a Relevance Engineer” training. You can [sign up for the course here](https://www.eventbee.com/v/opensearch-tlre-intensive-at-opensearchcon-eu-24/event?eid=276614264#/tickets).

7 May kicks off with a conference keynote presented by [Mukul Karnik](https://opensearch.org/community/members/mukul-karnik.html), general manager for OpenSearch at Amazon Web Services, and [Hariharan Gandhi](https://opensearch.org/community/members/hariharan-gandhi.html), product owner at SAP. After that, a full day of sessions will be presented across two rooms through the end of the conference.
