You're deep in the Amazon rainforest with just your wits, a machete, and a small cluster of Raspberry Pis running OpenSearch in your backpack. Suddenly, a mischievous monkey appears and grabs one of your Raspberry Pis! However, you realise that you're not only running OpenSearch on Raspberry Pi using juju. Your OpenSearch cluster uses Charmed OpenSearch, an open-source Virtual Machine (VM) operator, simplifying OpenSearch deployments for high availability, scalability, and observability in hybrid cloud environments, including an edge device.

After the monkey snatches your Raspberry Pi, you quickly access your OpenSearch dashboard and find a wealth of research on the Black Howler Monkey in the Amazon forest. You learn that it is terrified of marmite, so you use your emergency rations to scare the monkey away and retrieve the Raspberry Pi.

After getting your machine back, you plug the Raspberry Pi in and your Charmed OpenSearch automatically detects an additional node for a highly available OpenSearch. It backs up and restores the data collected by the monkey automatically. The stolen Raspberry Pi provided a wealth of knowledge gathered all over Amazon, thanks to OpenSearch gathering streams of data â€“ providing you with a better idea of how the rainforest looks.
