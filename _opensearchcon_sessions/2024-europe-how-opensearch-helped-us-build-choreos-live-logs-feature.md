Logs generated by containerized applications are used to observe what is going on within an application. This can be used effectively, especially when debugging, if the logs are made available without any significant delays.

When Choreo was built, it used the cloud provider’s native logging service. However this had a high log ingestion latency averaging between 20 seconds and 3 minutes. It was necessary to reduce this latency to improve the user experience. Furthermore, in order to ensure compliance, logs needed to remain within the cluster where they were generated. To address these requirements and provide a “tail -f” like experience for users in Choreo, this live logs feature was built by utilizing OpenSearch.

In this talk, I will explain how OpenSearch was utilized to implement this feature and our experience running it in multiple Kubernetes clusters.
