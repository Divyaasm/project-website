Uncovering the root causes of complex issues can be a daunting task, often requiring extensive data analysis and domain expertise. In this session, we'll explore how to leverage the power of AI agents augmented with OpenSearch, a powerful open-source search and analytics engine, to streamline root cause analysis. By combining natural language processing, machine learning, and OpenSearch's powerful search and analysis capabilities with metrics, logs, and knowledge bases, we'll demonstrate how AI agents can quickly sift through vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights. Attendees will learn how to enhance their root cause analysis workflows, accelerate problem resolution, and unlock new levels of operational efficiency.
